gateway advertised and stickered many of its 486 computers as `` pentium ready '' , meaning that a special type 3 zif socket pentium overdrive could be installed and run .

micronics designed the motherboards used by gateway , and the basis of the design was a prototype pentium overdrive with an internal write-through cache , a more conservative cache design .

grayson does not cite any virginia examples , but among the `` myths '' he attempts to explode are that illegal immigrants perform jobs americans do n't want and that they contribute more in taxes and social security than they take from government programs .

now , in a strange twist in all of this , just yesterday separate from the skeletal remains i alluded to earlier a man hiking near the berkeley marina found a bone , and they are now looking at that as another possible lead in this case .

pollack well , if it 's true and obviously we do n't know just yet but if it 's true , it is very significant because it 's effectively the iraqis admitting that many of the civilian casualties that we 've seen over the last few days may in fact have been caused by iraqi surface to air missiles falling back to ground in residential areas .

in the news , his brother was appealing -- for them to to sentence him to -- to prison for life rather than the death penalty , because -- he said he 's a very good listener and he cares about people , and and he might be able to help a lot of people in prison .

marco well , um , i would - i would have to start - -- i would have to start , generally , in stating - -- stating what i think is the problem and -- - with the middle east and what - for me , one of the major problems is the fact that -- the -- united states government gives so much aid to the state of israel .

in which , the state of israel buys -- many expensive military weapons , ah , which is used to -- oppress and -- to kill a lot of palestinians .

and , um , yasser arafat was kind of in a difficult position , because you have these , um , incredibly -- oppressed and in some ways imprisoned , uh , palestinians , and if -- arafat had n't , um , tried to stand up -- and help them and - and fight for their rights , then -- m - they would n't have respected arafat , but then again , you know , he could n't be too friendly with the west , um , and , um , and so he did the best he could , i think .

marco but , i , eh , i get the feeling that - -- it 's almost - -- the peace process - we ca n't put it on -- the ro - or the - -- the whole responsibility of the pre - -- peace process ca n't be the leader of -- a - -- a group that is - -- i do n't know , in my view , has -- not ver - not very many resources to fight - -- to fight this -- battle that -- their trying to fight against -- a government that has taken away a lot of their land , that , you know , does n't allow them to really move around in their own country .

these insider sales were certainly stupid , and probably criminal -lrb- though the legal proof may be hard to come by -rrb- but the solution is easy enough : they need to buy stock from the company itself , at some premium to the prices at which they sold -- they 'll have the same stake as before , the shareholders would have gotten their money back -lrb- since the premium goes to the company , which is owned by the shareholders -rrb- , and there 's no need to disrupt their business by taking the matter to court .

i think different people/different labours are different , so just because one person says `` i did *** and it did n't hurt a bit '' does n't mean that it will work for someone else , so going in with a set of suggestions , and being prepared to try them and see which is the best is probably the most helpful .

since you gave your uncle the shares prior to his discharge , the shares should have become assets available to the bankruptcy estate for the satisfaction of debts .

if the share transfer was reported to the trustee and the trustee did nothing about them , then you may be ok ; however , if you failed to inform the trustee , then your uncle may be liable for hiding assets , which would , at the minimum , invalidate his discharge .

that means that he received the shares while he was still in bankruptcy , which means that the shares were potentially assets that the trustee could use to pay off creditors .

if , however , your uncle received the shares after he obtained an order of discharge from the bankruptcy court , then as a general matter the creditors can not go after the shares , unless they can prove that there was collusion between you and your uncle to hide his assets from them -lrb- e.g. , by putting his assets in the corporation 's name and then waiting until after the bankruptcy to transfer the shares to him -rrb- .

having a combined ceo/chairman does reduce the ability of the board to act as a check on management and this does mean that you need to be more critical in your assessment of the trustworthiness of the top management team .

this downside of having a combined ceo/chair is offset by -lrb- 1 -rrb- a reduction of coordination and communication costs at the top of the organization and -lrb- 2 -rrb- an increase in the negotiating position of the ceo when dealing with suppliers , potential merger partners , etc. # 2 could be particularly useful in a dynamic industry .

the national carousel association was founded in the early 1970 's by a group of art historians and collectors , including frederick fried , author of the 1964 book `` a pictorial history of the carousel '' that single-handedly gave the classic hand-carved wooden carousel the respect and appreciation it deserved .

as such , during the 1980 's many beautiful and unique wooden carousels would be broken up at the auction block , as owners rushed to cash in on the antique marketplace .

the liability insurance crisis further aggravated the situation , as amusement park operators sought to cut their losses , while at the same time liquidate underperforming carousels to raise capital for the purchase of newer and more profitable -lrb- thrill -rrb- rides .

some collectors of carousel art and auction houses were accused of using their nca affiliation to gain information about vintage carousels that they could target for breakup to their own personal profit , a practice certainly contrary to the stated goals of the organization .

the increasing rift between the `` preservationists '' and `` collectors '' would eventually boil over into an internal political struggle that caused many in the collectors faction of the nca to walk out of the group , including founders such as charlotte dinger and others .

all in all , recommended , but afterwards , both my wife and i agreed that an `` all-day '' tour was too exhausting -lrb- even on a bus tour , you have to do a lot of walking especially getting to the changing of the guards and at the london tower -rrb- , and we probably would 've preferred breaking it into 2 1/2 day tours .

we 're planning on going july 4th week -- what better time to be in boston i figure :-rrb- saturday , july 2nd - fly from austin , tx to boston and stay with friends living in boston sunday , july 3rd - hang around boston and stay with friends monday , july 4th - hang around boston and stay with friends tuesday , july 5th - leave early and drive to niagara falls , ny - 467 miles - stay in niagara falls wednesday , july 6th - leave from niagara falls and drive to toronto , on - 85 miles - drive back to niagara falls that evening - 85 miles - stay in niagara falls thursday , july 7th - leave niagara falls and drive to red bank , ny - 435 miles - stay in red bank for the night - we want to hit-up jay and silent bob 's silent stash friday , july 8th - drive back to boston passing through new york -- do whatever -- 262 miles from red banks to boston but add whatever miles from new york - stay the night with friends in boston saturday , july 9th - fly back to austin i figure staying in red bank , nj , which is n't far from nyc , is cheaper then staying in the city .

many careless observers felt at the time that the success of lincoln was due entirely to the fact of there having been three opposing candidates in the field ; or , in other words , to the dissensions in the democratic party , which divided its vote between breckinridge and douglas .

it can of course be argued that the candidate of a united anti-lincoln opposition might have done better than all the otl anti-lincoln candidates combined , because the mere fact of the divided nature of lincoln 's opposition might have discouraged anti-lincoln men and led to fewer of them voting than would otherwise be the case .
