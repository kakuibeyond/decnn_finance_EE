the purpose of having a `` time limit '' would be as a mechanism to ensure compliance with the above principles ; that is , you would have a time limit because it would reduce the likelihood that someone would be tempted to violate the above prohibition ; it would give the voters time to elect a new eb that would consider the issues objectively .

this would have to include evidence that the eb had considered all the alternatives , including : - delegating the whole thing to the interim ed , which would be the normal practice in normal organizations with an ed - asking the interim ed to designate someone from the new windsor staff to act as move coordinator - asking the interim ed to hire some other consultant with experience in office relocation to manage the job -lrb- there are such people -rrb- - conducting some kind of actual search for candidates for the position during the last two months since the move was decided upon if they did consider alternatives , it would also have to include evidence that marinello has much more experience at relocating offices than other people , or is willing to do the job cheaper -lrb- although this would n't constitute being `` indispensible '' in my view -rrb- .

another argument , which is better but still disturbing , is that , yes , this is an ethics violation , and maybe worse , but it would only hurt the uscf to talk about it , and that only troublemakers like sam sloan , larry parr , and , i suppose , me , would talk about it , since doing so will obstruct the federation 's plans , cause us to pay legal expenses , run the risk of our being stuck without any office space at all , cause people not to loan us money , and so forth .
